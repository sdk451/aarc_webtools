-- Database initialization script for Docker
-- This file is automatically executed when the PostgreSQL container starts

-- Create database if it doesn't exist (this is handled by POSTGRES_DB env var)
-- Create user if it doesn't exist (this is handled by POSTGRES_USER env var)

-- The main schema will be created by the migration script
-- This file is here for any additional initialization needed
