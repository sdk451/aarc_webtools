## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context
- **Algorithm:** AARC's proprietary Hierarchical Risk Parity optimization methodology
- **Performance:** High-performance computing requirements for complex calculations
- **Visualization:** Advanced charting for hierarchical clustering and risk allocation

### HRP Algorithm Requirements
- **Hierarchical Clustering:** Asset correlation-based clustering algorithms
- **Risk Allocation:** Risk-based portfolio allocation instead of return-based
- **Diversification:** Superior diversification compared to traditional MPT
- **Constraints:** Support for user-defined constraints and risk parameters
- **Performance:** Real-time optimization with <10 second calculation times

### HRP Advantages
- **Better Diversification:** More robust diversification across market conditions
- **Risk Parity:** Equal risk contribution from all portfolio components
- **Stability:** More stable portfolio allocations over time
- **Out-of-Sample Performance:** Better performance in unseen market conditions
- **Drawdown Control:** Superior drawdown management and risk control

### Educational Content Requirements
- **HRP Methodology:** Explanation of hierarchical clustering and risk allocation
- **Advantages:** Benefits over traditional MPT optimization
- **Limitations:** When HRP may not be appropriate or effective
- **Research:** Academic research and empirical evidence supporting HRP
- **Implementation:** How HRP works in practice and what to expect

### Testing Standards
- **Test Location:** `/tests/hrp/` and `/tests/optimization/`
- **Testing Framework:** Jest, pytest, numerical algorithm testing
- **Test Coverage:** 95% for HRP algorithm, 90% for UI components
- **Algorithm Tests:** Verify HRP results against known benchmarks and AARC validation
- **Performance Tests:** Ensure <10 second optimization calculation times
