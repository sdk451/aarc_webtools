# Story 1.2: Free Risk/Return Simulator

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** beginner investor,

2. Tool calculates and displays expected return and risk metrics
3. Interactive charts show risk/return visualization
4. Educational tooltips explain risk and return concepts
5. Users can save and compare different portfolio scenarios
6. Results include clear disclaimers about educational purposes
7. Tool works on desktop and mobile devices
8. Performance is responsive with <2 second calculation times
