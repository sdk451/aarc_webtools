# Story 3.3: Trade Optimizer & Payoff Diagrams

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As an** Advanced Pro subscriber,
**I want** a professional-grade trade optimizer with interactive payoff diagrams,
**so that** I can analyze and optimize individual trades and options strategies with sophisticated visualization tools.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Trade optimizer supports analysis of individual securities and options strategies
2. Interactive payoff diagrams show profit/loss scenarios across different price levels
3. Greeks analysis displays risk metrics for options positions and strategies
4. Trade comparison tools allow analysis of multiple strategies simultaneously
5. Real-time market data integration provides current pricing and volatility inputs
6. Educational content explains trade analysis concepts and payoff diagram interpretation
7. Results include appropriate disclaimers about trading risks and market volatility
8. Export functionality allows saving and sharing of trade analysis results
