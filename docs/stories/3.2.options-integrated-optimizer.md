# Story 3.2: Options-Integrated Optimizer

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As an** Advanced Pro subscriber,
**I want** a unique options-inclusive portfolio optimizer,
**so that** I can optimize portfolios that include options strategies for enhanced risk management and return potential.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Options pricing models (Black-Scholes, Binomial) are integrated into optimization
2. Users can input options positions (calls, puts, spreads, straddles) alongside traditional assets
3. Optimization considers options Greeks (delta, gamma, theta, vega) in portfolio risk
4. Interactive payoff diagrams show options strategy impacts on portfolio performance
5. Scenario analysis shows portfolio behavior under different market conditions
6. Educational content explains options strategies and their portfolio integration
7. Results include clear disclaimers about options risks and complexity
8. Integration with existing portfolio analysis and risk management tools
