# Story 2.2: MPT Portfolio Optimizer

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** Basic Pro subscriber,
**I want** a Modern Portfolio Theory-based portfolio optimizer,
**so that** I can find optimal asset allocations based on my risk tolerance and return expectations.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Users can input their risk tolerance using interactive sliders
2. Optimizer calculates efficient frontier and optimal portfolio allocations
3. Results show expected return, risk, and Sharpe ratio for optimized portfolio
4. Interactive charts display efficient frontier and portfolio comparison
5. Users can compare multiple optimization scenarios
6. Educational content explains MPT concepts and optimization process
7. Results include appropriate disclaimers about optimization limitations
8. Tool integrates with existing portfolio analysis features

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context
- **Algorithm:** Modern Portfolio Theory with quadratic programming optimization
- **Data Requirements:** Historical returns, correlations, and volatility for asset classes
- **Visualization:** Interactive charts for efficient frontier and portfolio analysis

### MPT Optimization Requirements
- **Asset Classes:** Stocks, Bonds, International, REITs, Commodities, Cash
- **Constraints:** Long-only positions, maximum position limits, minimum position sizes
- **Risk Measures:** Standard deviation, Value at Risk, Conditional Value at Risk
- **Return Assumptions:** Historical averages, forward-looking estimates, user inputs

### Risk Tolerance Mapping
- **Conservative:** Low risk tolerance, higher bond allocation
- **Moderate:** Balanced risk tolerance, diversified allocation
- **Aggressive:** High risk tolerance, higher equity allocation
- **Custom:** User-defined risk parameters and constraints

### Testing Standards
- **Test Location:** `/tests/optimization/` and `/tests/mpt/`
- **Testing Framework:** Jest, pytest, numerical testing libraries
- **Test Coverage:** 95% for optimization algorithms, 85% for UI components
- **Algorithm Tests:** Verify optimization results against known benchmarks
- **Performance Tests:** Ensure <5 second optimization calculation times
