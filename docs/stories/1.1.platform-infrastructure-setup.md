## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context
- **Technology Stack:** Node.js/Express or Python/FastAPI backend, PostgreSQL database, Redis caching
- **Deployment:** Docker containerization with Kubernetes-ready configuration
- **Security:** JWT authentication with secure session management

### Database Schema Requirements
- **Users table:** id, email, password_hash, created_at, updated_at, last_login
- **Content table:** id, title, content, type, created_at, updated_at, published
- **Analytics table:** id, user_id, event_type, event_data, timestamp
- **Sessions table:** id, user_id, token, expires_at, created_at

### API Endpoints Required
- `POST /api/auth/register` - User registration
- `POST /api/auth/login` - User login
- `POST /api/auth/logout` - User logout
- `GET /api/auth/me` - Get current user
- `GET /api/health` - Health check
- `GET /api/content` - Get educational content

### Testing Standards
- **Test Location:** `/tests/backend/`
- **Testing Framework:** Jest (Node.js) or pytest (Python)
- **Test Coverage:** Minimum 80% for authentication and database operations
- **Integration Tests:** API endpoint testing with test database
- **Security Tests:** Authentication flow and input validation testing
